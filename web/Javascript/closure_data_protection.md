# Understanding Closure in JavaScript for Data Protection

In JavaScript, closures can be utilized to protect data received from outside the main thread in a browser environment. Let's delve into why and how closures can be used for this purpose.

## What is a Closure?

A closure is a function that retains access to its outer scope even after the outer scope has finished executing. This allows the function to access and manipulate variables from its lexical environment, even if that environment is no longer active.

## Protecting Data with Closure

Consider a scenario where you're fetching user data from an external source in a web application. You want to ensure that this data remains secure and inaccessible to any potentially malicious code injected into your application.

### Example:

```javascript
const userData = () => {
  return () => {
    const user = getUser();
    return user;
  };
};

const getUser = userData();

const user = getUser();
```
